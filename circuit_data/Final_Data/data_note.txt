Notes about the data:
The data here is for random graphs that were produced using the physiological fact sheet and for the neocortical columns “Average” dataset from Markram paper.
The random graphs have about 1/5 the neurons of the neocortical columns to allows us to generate them in a reasonable time.
More precisely, we have that the number of neurons any given type in any given layer is equal to number of neuron specified in the physiological data sheet divided by 5 rounded down.
If number of neuron specified in the the physiological data sheet divided by 5 rounded down would be zero, we instead set it to zero.
In order for us to be able to reasonable compute the homology of direct flag complex - we restrict our cell too analyzing only the graphs be formed between neurons in the same layer or between two different layers.
The labels “L4” in layer columns indicates the data was generated using neurons from the 4th layer and the label “L4_L23” would indicate the data was generated only using neuron with 4th layer and 23rd layer.


The two numbers in the name of the random samples represent the random seed given to the python random model to generate them.
Samples Random 12, 15, 17 maybe have issues due to the fact they where generated so that nodes may have edges to them self.
This structure is not allowed in directed flag complex so the result maybe thrown off.
Samples Random 23, 24, 25 do not suffer from this problem.
	

For approximations, we have that inputs under 3 MB are run generally run with no approximation.
Inputs between 3 MB and 10 MB are run with an approximation parameter of Flagser set 100,000.
This means any column of boundary matrix with over 100,000 1’s is not reduced and skipped.
Inputs over 10 MB are run with an approximation parameter of Flagser set to 10,000.
This means any column of boundary matrix with over 100,000 1’s is not reduced and skipped.

Approximation for the samples Random 23, 24, 25 are approximated differently due to me trying to get the data faster.
Files under the size 2.5 MB are not approximated, layer pair “L4_L5” is approximated with the approximation parameter set 100000, and all other data is approximated with the approximation parameter set to 5 MB.
