# CSCI 535 Project
Repository for resources and deliverables of the CSCI 535 Spring 2022 semester project. Including open source 
code from Reimann et al. (2017) and Markram et al. (2015). The code from the thes authors is for simulating a
neocortical column of a juvenile rat. This data is then used to create the directed flag complex of the structural
network, from which we compute the Betti numbers and a summary of complex constituents.
